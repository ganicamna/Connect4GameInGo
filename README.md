# Connect4GameInGo
Connect Four (4 in a row) game in Go (programming language).

Connect Four or  is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color (red or yellow) and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a vertically suspended grid. In our case, red player is always first one to play. Whichever player manages to **connect 4 tokens** of the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.

The project was done as part of the **IT 305 Programming Languages** course at International Burch University, and implemented in the **Go** programming language.

## Running the project

To run the project, you will first need to install Go on your machine. You can find detailed instructions [on this link](https://go.dev/doc/install). 

After installing Go, follow these steps to run the game:
```
git clone https://github.com/ganicamna/Connect4GameInGo.git
cd Connect4GameInGo
go run 4inarow.go
```
If that does not work, than open a new file, copy code from here and paste it there, and save it with .go extension. 

Then open command prompt/terminal window, navigate to folder where your file is saved, and then build and run the code using the command **go run nameOfYourGoFile.go** (for example **go run 4inarow.go**).

And that is it, you can play your game! Board will show on your cmd/terminal window along with the words "Player R's turn. Enter column number:"
