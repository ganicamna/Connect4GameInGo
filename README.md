# Connect4GameInGo
Connect Four game in Go (programming language).

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a vertically suspended grid. Whichever player manages to **connect 4 tokens** of the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.
The project was done as part of the **IT 305 Programming Languages** course at International Burch University, and implemented in the **Scala** programming language.
